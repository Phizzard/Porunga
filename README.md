## Introduction

CBC UI is an experimental library of presentational components to be used across applications using ReactJS. It is intended to work as building blocks.

We hope to deliver an easy to use component API that can be easily extendable to fit the functional and design needs for multiple platforms and audiences.

This is a 2019 innovation sprint project that can either take off to be implemented into a larger design system, influence directions and tech for future React based projects, or simply be an experimental playground for approaching a react ui library.

## Tools Used

- Emotion Styled
- Emotion Theming
- TypeScript
- Style Guidist
- Commitzen
- Snapshot Testing

## üèÉ Get Running

This library uses Styleguidist as documentation and playground for developing components.

Must be running node version `12.6.0`

install packages running

`yarn`

run local playground

`npm start`

## üëî Conventional Commits

This project follows [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) specifications. The Husky `commit-msg` hook checks that commit messages adhere to these standards using [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint).

### Commitizen

This project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to generate commit messages that adhere to Conventional Commit specifications. To use Commitizen, run `yarn cz`. This will walk you through generating a commit messsage by prompting you to enter following:

- Commit type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert)
- Scope (optional)
- Short description
- Long description (optional)
- Whether it produces any breaking changes
- Whether it closes any open issues

## Todo List

- [ ] Finalize theme stucture
