CBC UI is an experimental library of presentational components to be used across applications using ReactJS. It is intended to work as building blocks.

We hope to deliver an easy to use component API that can be easily extendable to fit the functional and design needs for multiple platforms and audiences.

This is a 2019 innovation sprint project that can either take off to be implemented into a larger design system, influence directions and tech for future React based projects, or simply be an experimental playground for approaching a react ui library.
